** This is currently a work in progress, some dependencies may change. React Native Navigation's new version is currently not stable and does not have @types available yet.**

This starter kit is designed to get you up and running with mobile development on the awesome React Native framework. There's just the right amount of now industry standard technologies packed in. Everything is written in TypeScript, uses Immutable(Seamless Immutable) data structures and Redux for state management.
